# Plans Consolidation

**Created:** April 18, 2025
**Updated:** April 18, 2025

## Overview

This directory contains consolidated versions of implementation plans that previously existed as separate files. The consolidation effort aims to streamline documentation, eliminate duplication, and ensure consistent information across all planning documents.

## Consolidation Status

| Original Files                                                              | Consolidated File        | Status       |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------ |
| - vercel_analytics_monitoring_plan.md<br>- vercel_analytics_upgrade_plan.md | vercel_analytics_plan.md | ✅ Completed |
| - plans/plans_audit.md<br>- plans/current/plans_audit.md                    | plans_audit.md           | ✅ Completed |

## Consolidation Details

1. **vercel_analytics_plan.md**

   - Created a comprehensive plan combining monitoring implementation details with the cost-benefit analysis of the upgrade plan
   - Merged content from both files into a logical flow
   - Status changed to "Active" to indicate it's the current version
   - All code examples preserved and organized

2. **plans_audit.md**
   - Combined content from both audit files
   - Added Vercel Analytics & Monitoring as a tracked plan with implementation status
   - Added more detailed Next Steps section
   - Updated formatting for consistency

## Files to be Deprecated

Once the following references are updated, these files should be deprecated:

1. Original analytics plans:

   - `plans/current/vercel_analytics_monitoring_plan.md`
   - `plans/current/vercel_analytics_upgrade_plan.md`

2. Original audit files:
   - `plans/current/plans_audit.md`
   - `plans/plans_audit.md`

## Next Steps
