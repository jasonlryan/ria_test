# Cache Upgrade Implementation Plan

**Last Updated:** Sun May 12 2025

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for upgrading the caching mechanism in the RIA25 application. The goal was to introduce a more granular cache for processed segment statistics and make the data retrieval process (specifically `1_data_retrieval.md` logic) aware of this cache. This improves efficiency, reduces redundant processing, and enables smarter handling of follow-up queries.

## 2. Goals

- Implement a granular cache for (file + segment) processed statistics. **(Complete)**
- Persistently track all raw segments available within each data file. **(Complete)**
- Modify `1_data_retrieval.md` logic to be aware of and utilize the granular cache and available raw segment information. **(Complete)**
- Update the backend orchestration layer to manage cache reads/writes and conditionally invoke `SmartFilteringProcessor`. **(Complete)**
- Ensure graceful fallback mechanisms if cache entries are missing. **(Complete)**

## 3. Cache Design

The Redis KV store is now used for this enhanced caching, with all keys and values handled defensively and consistently.

## 4. Implementation Steps (All Complete)

### Step 4.1: Modify `SmartFilteringProcessor` (or its calling orchestrator)

- The orchestrator now populates both the available raw segments cache and the granular statistics cache after SmartFilteringProcessor runs.

### Step 4.2: Update Data Retrieval Logic (Backend preparing for `1_data_retrieval.md`)

- The backend checks the cache for available segments and cached stats before invoking SmartFilteringProcessor, especially for follow-up queries.

### Step 4.3: Modify `1_data_retrieval.md` Prompt

- The prompt is aware of cached segments and available raw segments, and instructs the LLM to use this information for follow-ups.

### Step 4.4: Update Orchestration Layer (Post `1_data_retrieval.md`, Pre `SmartFilteringProcessor`)

- The orchestrator combines cached and newly processed stats and passes them to the assistant prompt.

### Step 4.5: Cache Invalidation Strategy

- Initial TTL-based invalidation is in place. More advanced event-driven or manual invalidation may be considered in the future.

### Step 4.6: Testing

- Manual and integration testing have been performed. Additional automated unit and integration tests are recommended, especially for edge cases and cache fallback scenarios.

## 5. Final Fixes and Completion

- The cache read for `stats:<file_id>:<segment_id>` is now fully defensive: it handles both string and object values, parses as needed, and logs errors if parsing failsâ€”preventing runtime errors from malformed or double-parsed cache data.
- All cache writes for stats and segment data use `JSON.stringify`.
- The system robustly supports granular, segment-level caching and safe retrieval for all follow-up and multi-segment queries.

## 6. Status

**The cache upgrade is now fully implemented, tested, and deployed.**
