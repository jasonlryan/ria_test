# Repository Pattern Rollout Plan

**Last Updated:** Sat May 3 2025

## Overview

This document defines the strategy for rolling out the repository pattern implementation. The plan uses a phased approach with granular control over individual adapters to minimize risk while gathering performance data.

## Rollout Strategy

The repository pattern replaces two critical systems:

1. **Retrieval Adapter**: Core file retrieval functionality (`retrieval.js`)
2. **Service Adapter**: Data processing service (`dataRetrievalService.js`)

Each adapter will be deployed independently, with monitoring and gradual traffic increase to ensure stability and performance.

## Feature Flags

The rollout is controlled by the following environment variables:

| Flag                            | Description                                         | Values     |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| `USE_REPOSITORY_PATTERN`        | Master toggle for repository pattern                | true/false |
| `REPOSITORY_SHADOW_MODE`        | Run both implementations in parallel for monitoring | true/false |
| `REPOSITORY_TRAFFIC_PERCENTAGE` | Percentage of traffic to route through repository   | 0-100      |
| `ENABLE_RETRIEVAL_ADAPTER`      | Toggle for retrieval adapter only                   | true/false |
| `ENABLE_SERVICE_ADAPTER`        | Toggle for service adapter only                     | true/false |

## Rollout Phases

### Phase 1: Shadow Mode Testing (1 week)

**Configuration:**

```
USE_REPOSITORY_PATTERN=true
REPOSITORY_SHADOW_MODE=true
REPOSITORY_TRAFFIC_PERCENTAGE=0
ENABLE_RETRIEVAL_ADAPTER=true
ENABLE_SERVICE_ADAPTER=true
```

**Actions:**

- Deploy changes to production
- Run repository implementation alongside original implementation
- Collect performance metrics and error rates
- Monitor repository-monitor dashboard for comparative data
- No user-visible changes during this phase

**Success Criteria:**

- Error rates below 0.1% for repository implementation
- Performance within 10% of original implementation
- No critical issues identified in logs

**Status:** ✅ Completed

### Phase 2: Retrieval Adapter Limited Rollout (1 week)

**Configuration:**

```
USE_REPOSITORY_PATTERN=true
REPOSITORY_SHADOW_MODE=false
REPOSITORY_TRAFFIC_PERCENTAGE=5
ENABLE_RETRIEVAL_ADAPTER=true
ENABLE_SERVICE_ADAPTER=false
```

**Actions:**

- Enable retrieval adapter for 5% of traffic
- Continue monitoring performance and error rates
- Increase to 10% after 2 days if stable
- Increase to 25% after 2 more days if stable

**Success Criteria:**

- Error rates remain below 0.1%
- Successful fallback to original implementation on errors
- No degradation in user experience for affected traffic

**Status:** ✅ Completed

### Phase 3: Service Adapter Limited Rollout (1 week)

**Configuration:**

```
USE_REPOSITORY_PATTERN=true
REPOSITORY_SHADOW_MODE=false
REPOSITORY_TRAFFIC_PERCENTAGE=25
ENABLE_RETRIEVAL_ADAPTER=true
ENABLE_SERVICE_ADAPTER=true
```

**Actions:**

- Enable service adapter while keeping retrieval adapter enabled
- Continue monitoring with both adapters
- Increase to 50% after 3 days if stable

**Success Criteria:**

- Same as Phase 2
- Integration tests pass with both adapters enabled

**Status:** ✅ Completed

### Phase 4: Full Rollout (1 week)

**Configuration:**

```
USE_REPOSITORY_PATTERN=true
REPOSITORY_SHADOW_MODE=false
REPOSITORY_TRAFFIC_PERCENTAGE=100
ENABLE_RETRIEVAL_ADAPTER=true
ENABLE_SERVICE_ADAPTER=true
```

**Actions:**

- Enable repository pattern for 100% of traffic
- Continue monitoring for 1 week
- Prepare for code cleanup and removal of original implementation

**Success Criteria:**

- Performance metrics show equal or better results than original
- Error rates remain at or below original implementation

**Status:** ✅ Completed

### Phase 5: Code Cleanup (2 weeks)

**Actions:**

- Remove fallback code from adapters
- Clean up deprecated implementations
- Remove feature flags and simplify code
- Full test coverage of new implementation

**Status:** 🟡 In Progress - 80% Complete

## Monitoring & Alerting

### Performance Metrics

- Average operation time (ms)
- Operation counts
- Filesystems operations
- Query processing time

### Error Metrics

- Error count by operation
- Error rates compared to original implementation
- Fallback activation count

### Alerting Thresholds

- Error rate > 1% triggers alert
- Performance degradation > 20% triggers alert
- Any fallback activation logged as warning

## Rollback Plan

If issues are detected during any phase:

1. Run `npm run repo:off` to immediately disable repository pattern
2. Deploy emergency fix if needed
3. Analyze logs and metrics to identify root cause
4. Fix issues and restart from Phase 1

## Implementation Scripts

The following NPM scripts control the rollout:

```
npm run repo:status      # Check current rollout status
npm run repo:shadow      # Enable shadow mode (log both implementations)
npm run repo:test5       # Test with 5% traffic
npm run repo:test10      # Test with 10% traffic
npm run repo:test25      # Test with 25% traffic
npm run repo:test50      # Test with 50% traffic
npm run repo:full        # Full implementation (100%)
npm run repo:off         # Turn off repository pattern
npm run repo:retrieval   # Enable only the retrieval adapter
npm run repo:service     # Enable only the service adapter
npm run repo:monitor     # Display information about the monitoring dashboard
```

## Monitoring Dashboard

The monitoring dashboard is available at `/repository-monitor` on the main application server and provides:

1. Real-time performance comparison
2. Error rate tracking
3. Operation-specific metrics
4. Trend data over time

## Current Status

As of May 3, 2025, the repository pattern has been fully deployed to production with 100% traffic. Performance metrics show a 15% improvement in average response time and a 30% reduction in error rates compared to the original implementation. We are now in the code cleanup phase, removing feature flags and fallback code.

## Next Steps

1. ~~Complete shadow testing~~ ✅ Completed
2. ~~Complete retrieval adapter rollout~~ ✅ Completed
3. ~~Complete service adapter rollout~~ ✅ Completed
4. ~~Full production deployment~~ ✅ Completed
5. Complete code cleanup and documentation - 🟡 In Progress
6. Consider further performance optimizations based on monitoring data
