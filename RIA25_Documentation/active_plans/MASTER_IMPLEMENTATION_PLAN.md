# RIA25 Master Implementation Plan

**Last Updated:** Mon May 12 13:28:49 BST 2025

## Executive Summary

This Master Implementation Plan consolidates all project documentation into a single source of truth for the RIA25 project, focusing on:

1. **OpenAI Responses API Migration** (98% Complete)
2. **Repository Pattern Implementation** (100% Complete)
3. **Architecture Standardization** (85% Complete)
4. **Compatibility Enhancements** (65% Complete)
5. **Testing Infrastructure** (100% Complete)

The project is progressing well with all critical components now operational. The primary focus remains on completing the OpenAI Responses API Migration as outlined in the dedicated plan. The repository pattern implementation is now complete with all planned tasks successfully implemented. Architecture standardization has made significant progress, and compatibility enhancements are progressing steadily with recent improvements to the compatibility gate.

### Updated Status Summary

- Remaining JS files in utils/openai have been converted to TypeScript, with only sync-prompts.js pending final review.
- Vitest tests for compatibility features are fully implemented and actively maintained in tests/compatibility.
- Debug logging cleanup is complete; all legacy debug logs have been removed or converted to structured logging.
- Developer documentation is comprehensive and actively updated in RIA25_Documentation/utility_documentation/docs and plans directories.

This update reflects the current state of the repository and legacy code migration efforts.

## Current Issues

The current implementation has identified these key issues that need immediate attention:

1. **Streaming Completion Issues**: Several critical bugs related to streaming completions and segment persistence identified on May 11th are being actively addressed. Progress is being made with some fixes already deployed.

2. **Follow-up Query Context Loss**: Issues with context persistence between query turns have been identified and fixes are being implemented.

## Integration Testing Strategy

A comprehensive testing strategy has been implemented using Vitest:

1. **Unit Tests**: Testing individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Testing interactions between components
3. **Shadow Tests**: Comparing new and legacy implementations
4. **E2E Tests**: Verifying complete user flows

All planned tests have been implemented with additional tests for recent fixes in progress.

## Rollout Plan

The rollout will use a phased approach with feature flags:

1. **Phase 1: Shadow Mode** (Completed)

   - Run both implementations side-by-side for comparison
   - No user-visible changes

2. **Phase 2: Limited Rollout** (Completed)

   - Enable repository pattern for 5-25% of traffic
   - Monitor for issues

3. **Phase 3: Combined Adapter Rollout** (Completed)

   - Enable service adapter alongside retrieval adapter
   - Increase to 50% traffic if stable

4. **Phase 4: Full Rollout** (In Progress)

   - Enable for 100% of traffic
   - Continue monitoring for 1 week

5. **Phase 5: Code Cleanup** (In Progress)
   - Remove fallback code
   - Clean up deprecated implementations
   - Remove feature flags

## Notes on Consolidated Plans

This Master Implementation Plan now incorporates elements from the following plans, which have been moved to the 'complete' directory:

1. **Retrieval System Refactoring** - Core functionality completed
2. **No-BS Implementation Plan** - Key objectives achieved with OpenAI service consolidation and caching system cleanup
3. **Compatibility Enhancements** - Initial fixes implemented with ongoing work scheduled
4. **Architecture Refactoring** - Major components implemented with additional standardization ongoing

The primary focus remains the OpenAI Responses API Migration as detailed in the dedicated plan.
