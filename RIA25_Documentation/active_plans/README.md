# Implementation Plans Directory

**Last Updated:** Mon May 12 13:28:49 BST 2025

This directory contains various implementation plans for the RIA25 project. The plans have been organized into two main subdirectories based on their implementation status:

## Directory Structure

- `complete/` - Contains plans that have been fully implemented in the codebase
- `current/` - Contains plans that are either partially implemented or not yet implemented

## Complete Plans (✅)

The following plans have been fully implemented:

1. **Data Retrieval Optimization** - Efficient file identification and data retrieval
2. **Direct File Access Mode** - Toggle-able direct file access with fallbacks
3. **Incremental Segment Retrieval** - Thread-specific caching for efficient follow-up queries
4. **OpenAI API Optimization** - Improved performance and response time
5. **Smart Filtering Implementation** - Demographic segment detection and data filtering
6. **Starter Question Optimization** - Fast-path processing for starter questions
7. **Data Compatibility Implementation** - Blocking incompatible year-on-year comparisons
8. **Data Comparison Fix** - Filtering logic for incomparable data in comparisons
9. **Data Compatibility Integration** - Integration of compatibility checks throughout the system
10. **Retrieval System Refactoring** - Consolidation of the retrieval system architecture
11. **No-BS Implementation Plan** - Efficient codebase cleanup and OpenAI service unification
12. **Compatibility Gate Enhancement** - Hardened compatibility gate for year-on-year comparisons
13. **Architecture Pattern Standardization** - Standardized controller-service pattern implementation
14. **Repository Pattern Implementation** - Complete repository pattern with clean architecture (NEWLY COMPLETED)
15. **Testing Infrastructure** - Comprehensive testing framework with Vitest (NEWLY COMPLETED)

## Current Plans (⚠️ or ❌)

The following plans are in progress or pending implementation:

1. **API Refactoring** (⚠️ 85% Implemented) - Standardizing API architecture
2. **Logging Migration** (✅ Completed) - Structured logging system
3. **Shared Utilities Library** (⚠️ 90% Implemented) - Centralized utility functions
4. **Smart Filtering and Segment-Aware Caching** (⚠️ 75% Implemented) - Enhanced caching
5. **Vercel KV Cache Migration** (⚠️ 15% Implemented) - Production-ready persistent caching
6. **Compatibility Enhancements** (⚠️ 65% Implemented) - Advanced features for compatibility handling
7. **OpenAI Responses API Migration** (⚠️ 98% Implemented) - Migration to OpenAI's new Responses API

## Implementation Priority

1. **Critical Priority**:

   - OpenAI Responses API Migration (98% Complete - Scheduled for Jun 21)
   - Fix Streaming Completion & Segment Persistence Issues

2. **High Priority**:

   - Complete Smart Filtering and Segment-Aware Caching
   - Vercel KV Cache Migration

3. **Medium Priority**:
   - Continue Compatibility Enhancements
   - Complete Shared Utilities Library
   - Complete API Refactoring

## Recent Accomplishments (June 2025)

1. **Repository Pattern Implementation** - Completed with all interfaces, adapters, and clean architecture principles
2. **Testing Infrastructure** - Fully implemented with comprehensive unit and integration tests
3. **Logging Migration** - Completed structured logging system with performance tracking
4. **Performance Optimizations** - Implemented key optimizations reducing P95 latency from 12s to 5.2s:
   - Duplicate file discovery elimination
   - In-memory JSON caching
   - Streaming enhancements

## Current Focus

The team is currently focused on addressing critical streaming issues and completing the OpenAI Responses API migration for the scheduled June 21, 2025 rollout.
