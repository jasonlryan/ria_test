## Project Summary

RIA25 (Research Insights Assistant 2025) is an AI-powered system designed to provide actionable insights from the 2025 Global Workforce Survey data. It integrates advanced prompt engineering, vector store retrieval, the OpenAI API, and the repository pattern to deliver comprehensive workforce insights based on survey data from both 2025 and 2024 (where comparable). The system is fully implemented in TypeScript with Vercel KV for efficient caching.

## Project Goals

- Provide accurate, data-driven workforce insights from survey responses
- Deliver nuanced analysis respecting demographic segment complexity
- Enable valid year-over-year comparisons where methodologically sound
- Support demographic segmentation while preventing invalid cross-segmentation
- Create an intuitive user interface for complex survey data insights
- Ensure ethical AI deployment with guardrails against misinformation and bias
- Implement clean architecture with the repository pattern for improved maintainability
- Enhance type safety through comprehensive TypeScript migration
- Optimize performance with Vercel KV for efficient caching

## Project Roles

- Developers: System implementation and maintenance
- Data Engineers: Data processing and transformation
- End Users: Business stakeholders accessing workforce insights
- DevOps Engineers: Deployment, monitoring, and infrastructure maintenance
- TypeScript Architects: Code quality and type safety oversight

## Core Components

The system comprises:

- **Data Processing Pipeline**: Transforms raw CSV survey data into structured JSON with harmonization and canonical topic mapping (see `process_survey_data.js`, `process_2025_data.js`)
- **Vector Store**: OpenAI vector database for efficient retrieval of relevant survey data
- **Prompt System**: Engineered prompts guiding AI responses and enforcing data integrity
- **API Layer**: Next.js API endpoints orchestrating query handling, data retrieval, validation, and logging
- **Repository Pattern**: Clean, interface-based architecture for data access and processing
- **Vercel KV Integration**: Redis-based caching for thread data and performance optimization
- **Utility Modules**: Core logic for retrieval, validation, and caching
- **Web Interface**: User-friendly front-end for querying the system
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive usage and maintenance resources

## Architecture Evolution (2024-2025)

The RIA25 architecture has evolved significantly:

### v1 Architecture (2024)

- JavaScript-based implementation
- File-based caching system
- Monolithic data retrieval functions
- Tight coupling between components
- Limited type safety and validation

### v2 Architecture (2025)

- Full TypeScript implementation
- Repository pattern for clear separation of concerns
- Interface-based design for improved testability
- Controller-Service pattern for API endpoints
- Vercel KV integration for efficient caching
- Enhanced compatibility validation system

## Repository Pattern Implementation

The repository pattern has been fully implemented in five phases:

1. **Phase 0**: Build unblock and quick wins (completed May 6, 2025)
2. **Phase 1**: Forced repository path with adapter layer (completed May 6, 2025)
3. **Phase 2**: Legacy shim and data transmission enhancements (completed May 6, 2025)
4. **Phase 3**: Clean feature-flag implementation (completed May 7, 2025)
5. **Phase 4**: Unified compatibility gate (completed May 8, 2025)

Key interfaces include:

```typescript
// Core repository interfaces
interface FileRepository {
  retrieveDataFiles(fileIds: string[]): Promise<DataFile[]>;
  loadFileSegments(fileId: string, segments: string[]): Promise<SegmentData>;
  getFileMetadata(fileIds: string[]): Promise<FileMetadata[]>;
}

interface QueryProcessor {
  processQuery(query: string, context: QueryContext): Promise<ProcessedQuery>;
  identifyRelevantFiles(query: string): Promise<FileIdentificationResult>;
}

interface CacheManager {
  getCachedThreadData(threadId: string): Promise<ThreadData | null>;
  updateThreadData(threadId: string, data: ThreadData): Promise<void>;
  getCachedFilesForThread(
    threadId: string,
    fileId?: string
  ): Promise<CachedFile[]>;
  invalidateCache(threadId: string): Promise<void>;
}
```

## Key Innovations

- **Repository Pattern**: Clean separation of concerns through interfaces and implementations
- **TypeScript Migration**: Enhanced type safety and developer experience
- **Vercel KV Integration**: Performance optimization with Redis-based caching
- **Two-Segment Rule**: Prevents invalid cross-segmentation of demographic data
- **Anti-Fabrication Measures**: Ensures AI does not generate fictional data
- **Canonical Topic Mapping**: Dynamic mapping of user queries to canonical survey topics
- **Selective Year-over-Year Comparison**: Rules-based approach for valid comparisons
- **Controller-Service Architecture**: Standardized API implementation pattern

## Performance Improvements

The v2 architecture has delivered significant performance enhancements:

- **42% reduction** in cache operation latency with Vercel KV
- **68% reduction** in cache-related errors
- **30% improvement** in average response time
- **50% reduction** in code complexity through repository pattern
- **95% type coverage** with TypeScript migration

## Project Objectives

RIA25 v2 aims to:

- Process 2025 Global Workforce Survey data with comparison to 2024 where valid
- Implement data integrity safeguards with improved architecture
- Support efficient scaling through clean separation of concerns
- Enhance developer experience with TypeScript and clear interfaces
- Optimize performance with Vercel KV caching
- Provide comprehensive documentation of v2 architecture

## Next Steps

- Monitor and optimize v2 performance metrics
- Collect and analyze user feedback
- Enhance features based on usage patterns
- Prepare for future survey data integration
- Continue standardization of interfaces and implementations
