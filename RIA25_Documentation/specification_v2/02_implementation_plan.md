## Overview

This document outlines the implemented architecture, development workflow, and technical decisions for the RIA25 system, reflecting the actual build rather than initial planning. The v2 update includes repository pattern implementation, TypeScript migration, and Vercel KV integration.

## System Components

### 1. Data Processing Pipeline

- **Implemented Solution**: Node.js scripts (JavaScript) to process CSV data into structured JSON
- **Key Scripts**:
  - `process_survey_data.js`: Transforms raw CSV data into structured JSON files
  - `process_2025_data.js`: Handles 2025-specific data harmonization
- **Output Format**: JSON files split by question number with consistent metadata structure
- **Location**: `scripts/` directory

### 2. Repository Pattern

- **Purpose**: Clean separation of concerns and improved testability
- **Implementation Phases**:
  - Phase 0: Build unblock and quick wins
  - Phase 1: Forced repository path
  - Phase 2: Legacy shim and data transmission
  - Phase 3: Clean feature-flag implementation
  - Phase 4: Unified compatibility gate
- **Key Interfaces**:
  - FileRepository: Data file access
  - QueryProcessor: Query handling and file identification
  - FilterProcessor: Data filtering and segment handling
  - CacheManager: Thread and file caching

### 3. Vercel KV Integration

## Technical Decisions

### Repository Pattern

The repository pattern was chosen for several key benefits:

1. **Separation of Concerns**

   - Clear interfaces define contracts
   - Implementations can be swapped without affecting consumers
   - Modular approach improves maintainability

2. **Testability**

   - Interfaces enable mock implementations for testing
   - Reduces test complexity
   - Improves test coverage and reliability

3. **Flexibility**

   - Allows different data sources (file system, API, mock)
   - Simplifies future enhancements
   - Supports incremental refactoring

4. **Type Safety**
   - TypeScript interfaces ensure type checking
   - Consistent data structures
   - Compile-time validation

### Vercel KV Integration

Vercel KV was selected over file-based caching for:

1. **Performance**

   - 42% reduction in cache operation latency
   - Low-latency read/write operations
   - Reduced cold start impact

2. **Reliability**

   - Persistent storage across function invocations
   - Elimination of ephemeral filesystem limitations
   - Consistent data availability in serverless environment

3. **Operational Benefits**

   - Centralized cache management
   - Built-in monitoring and alerting
   - Simplified scaling across regions

4. **Development Experience**
   - Local fallback for development
   - Simplified testing
   - Consistent API across environments

### Data Structure

The implemented system uses individual JSON files for each question, with:

- Consistent metadata structure
- Demographic information
- Response data
- Year information

This approach was chosen over alternatives (single large JSON file, database) for:

- Simplified vector store ingestion
- Reduced memory requirements
- Improved retrieval accuracy

### Segment Handling

The implementation enforces a two-segment maximum rule:

- Prevents invalid cross-segmentation
- Maintains statistical validity
- Ensures response accuracy

### API Integration

OpenAI Assistants API was selected over alternatives due to:

- Built-in vector search capabilities
- Simplified file management
- Reduced development complexity
- Strong performance characteristics
