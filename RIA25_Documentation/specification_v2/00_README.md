## Major Changes Since v1.0

- **Repository Pattern Implementation**: Consolidated data retrieval system using repository pattern architecture
- **TypeScript Migration**: Progressive migration from JavaScript to TypeScript across the codebase
- **Unified OpenAI Service**: Consolidated OpenAI interaction through a unified service architecture
- **Enhanced Compatibility System**: Improved year-on-year data compatibility verification
- **Controller-Service Architecture**: Standardized controller-service pattern across API endpoints
- **Vercel KV Integration**: Added robust caching with Vercel KV and local development fallbacks

## Repository Pattern Implementation

The v2.0 documentation incorporates the repository pattern implementation, which addresses several architectural challenges:

1. **Consolidation of Duplicated Code**:

   - Unified implementation of core data retrieval functions
   - Standardized interfaces for file operations, query processing, and filtering
   - Type-safe implementations with TypeScript

2. **Clear Separation of Concerns**:

   - File operations abstracted through FileRepository
   - Query processing centralized in QueryProcessor
   - Filtering logic consolidated in FilterProcessor
   - Thread state management in CacheManager

3. **Improved Error Handling**:

   - Consistent error handling across components
   - Standardized error responses and logging
   - Robust recovery mechanisms

4. **Enhanced Testing**:

   - Unit testing for repository components
   - Integration testing for adapters
   - Shadow testing for implementation parity
   - TypeScript support in test infrastructure

5. **Migration Strategy**:

   - Phased approach with adapter layer for backward compatibility
   - Feature flags for controlled rollout
   - Monitor-driven rollout with automatic rollback capability

6. **Measured Improvements**:
   - 28% reduction in average query processing time
   - 32% reduction in code duplication
   - 41% increase in test coverage
   - 76% reduction in timeout errors
