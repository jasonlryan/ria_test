- Added thread management best practices

### 7. File Function Reference (17_file_function_reference.md)

- Created comprehensive mapping of files and functions
- Documented all major components by directory
- Detailed function documentation for all critical paths
- Provided clear references between files and their purposes
- Supports code navigation and maintenance

## Section Numbering Plan

A comprehensive section numbering plan was created and implemented:

1. **Clean Numbering Scheme**

   - Removed letter suffixes (e.g., changed 03A to 03, 03B to 04)
   - Established sequential numbering from 00 to 17
   - Created clear mapping from old to new numbers

2. **Supporting Tools**

   - Created `rename_files.sh` script to handle file renaming
   - Created `update_references.sh` script to update cross-references
   - Documented renaming process and file mapping

3. **Supporting Files**
   - Updated `documentation_map.md` to reflect new numbering scheme
   - Updated `generate_documentation.sh` to work with new file names
   - Created detailed documentation of the renaming process

## Other Improvements

1. **Standardized Headers**

   - Added consistent formatting across all specification files
   - Included last updated date, target audience, and related documents
   - Added document status indicators

2. **Enhanced Code Examples**

   - Updated code snippets to match current implementation
   - Added detailed comments and explanations
   - Ensured all examples are accurate and runnable

3. **Cross-References**

   - Added clear references between related documents
   - Updated all internal links to reflect new file names
   - Enhanced navigation between documentation sections

4. **Generated Updated Documentation**
   - Created updated composite documentation file
   - Generated DOCX, PDF, and HTML versions
   - Ensured proper formatting and styling

## Remaining Updates

The following files still need to be updated:

1. **Vercel Deployment Guide (11_vercel_deployment_guide.md)**

   - Update with latest deployment process
   - Include environment variable configuration
   - Document production vs. development differences

2. **Development Timeline (09_development_timeline.md)**

   - Incorporate current status information
   - Update project timeline and milestones
   - Document technical challenges and solutions

3. **Glossary (16_glossary.md)**
   - Create comprehensive technical glossary
   - Include all domain-specific terms
   - Add architectural components and patterns

## Impact of Updates

These documentation updates have significantly improved the RIA25 documentation quality:

1. **Accuracy**: Documentation now accurately reflects the current state of the codebase
2. **Completeness**: All major components and patterns are now documented
3. **Consistency**: Consistent formatting, terminology, and structure across all files
4. **Usability**: Better organization and cross-references make information easier to find
5. **Maintainability**: Clear structure makes future updates easier to implement

## Next Steps

1. Continue updates for the remaining files
2. Review all files for consistency and completeness
3. Conduct final review of complete documentation
4. Archive outdated documentation that's now fully integrated
