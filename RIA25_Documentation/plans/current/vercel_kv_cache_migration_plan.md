# Vercel KV Store Cache Migration Plan

## Objective

Migrate the current file-based caching system to use Vercel's KV Store to ensure persistent, scalable, and reliable cache storage in the serverless environment.

## Background

- The existing cache implementation uses local file system storage under `/cache`.
- Vercel serverless functions have ephemeral, read-only file systems.
- Files written during a function execution do not persist beyond that execution.
- This causes cache loss between invocations, breaking thread continuity and degrading user experience.

## Goals

- Replace file-based cache reads and writes with KV store operations.
- Maintain existing cache data structure and semantics.
- Ensure cache persistence across serverless function invocations.
- Preserve or improve cache performance and reliability.
- Add error handling and fallback mechanisms for KV store operations.

## Approach

### 1. Modify Cache Utilities (`cache-utils.ts`)

- Replace `fs` file read/write operations with `@vercel/kv` client calls.
- Implement `getCachedFilesForThread` to retrieve cache data from KV store by thread ID.
- Implement `updateThreadCache` to write cache data to KV store.
- Convert loadedSegments and availableSegments between arrays and Sets as needed.
- Handle JSON serialization/deserialization for cache data.

### 2. Update Data Retrieval Service and Controllers

- Ensure all cache interactions use the updated cache utilities.
- Verify that cache retrieval and updates work seamlessly with KV store.
- Maintain existing logging for cache operations.

### 3. Testing and Validation

- Test cache persistence across multiple serverless function invocations.
- Validate lazy loading behavior with KV store-backed cache.
- Monitor performance and error rates.
- Add unit and integration tests for cache utilities with KV store.

### 4. Deployment and Monitoring

- Deploy changes to Vercel.
- Monitor cache usage, latency, and error logs.
- Implement alerts for cache failures or performance degradation.

## Considerations

- KV store has usage limits and costs; monitor usage accordingly.
- Ensure secure access to KV store credentials.
- Plan for migration of existing cache data if needed.

## Next Steps

- Implement KV store-based cache utilities.
- Update service and controller code to use new cache utilities.
- Develop and run tests.
- Deploy and monitor in Vercel environment.
