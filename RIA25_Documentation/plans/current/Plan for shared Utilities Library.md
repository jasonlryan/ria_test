# Plan for Shared Utilities Library and Modularization

## Completed ‚úÖ

- Created shared utilities directory at /utils/shared
- Extracted CORS and preflight handling into utils/shared/cors.js
- Created shared logger helpers in utils/shared/loggerHelpers.js
- Refactored app/api/chat-assistant/route.ts to use shared logger helpers
- Refactored utils/openai/retrieval.js to use shared logger helpers
- Extracted error handling and response formatting into utils/shared/errorHandler.js
- Refactored app/api/chat-assistant/route.ts to use shared error handler
- Extracted helper utilities (e.g., sanitizeOutput, isJsonContent) into utils/shared/utils.js
- Refactored app/api/chat-assistant/route.ts to use shared helper utilities
- Extracted polling logic (e.g., waitForNoActiveRuns) into utils/shared/polling.js
- Refactored app/api/chat-assistant/route.ts to use shared polling module
- Created service layer modules:
  - threadService.js for thread/reuse logic and polling
  - dataRetrievalService.js for data retrieval, smart filtering, caching, and query processing
  - openaiService.js for OpenAI API interactions (run creation, message submission, tool call processing)
- Refactored chatAssistantController.ts to delegate core logic to service modules

## Remaining üõ†Ô∏è

- Refactor other route handlers to use shared errorHandler, utils, and polling modules
- Consolidate similar route handlers (e.g., POST and PUT) to share common controller logic
- Add or update unit and integration tests for shared modules and refactored routes
- Validate logging, error handling, and polling behavior after refactoring
- Test each route incrementally to ensure integration with controllers and services
- Gradually refactor existing routes to the new routing pattern

- app/api/test-openai/route.ts
  - Delegates to testOpenAIController with GET, OPTIONS handlers.

## New Workstream: Refactor HTTP Routes into Clean Controllers üß©

## Priority: Medium

## New Workstream: Testing and Validation üß™

## Priority: High

### Tasks:

- Develop unit tests for shared utilities, service modules, and controllers.
- Create integration tests for API routes to verify end-to-end functionality.
- Implement automated testing workflows (e.g., using Jest, Testing Library).
- Validate logging, error handling, and polling behavior under various scenarios.
- Perform load and performance testing to ensure scalability.
- Continuously monitor and update tests as the codebase evolves.

## Benefits:

- Ensures code quality and reliability.
- Facilitates safe refactoring and future enhancements.
- Provides confidence in system stability and performance.
- Reduces manual testing effort and human error.

### New Workstream: Lazy-Loading Additional Segments for Cached Files üöÄ

## Priority: High

### Tasks:

- Extend Cache Structure:

  - Add metadata fields to cached files: loadedSegments and availableSegments.
  - Parse files to extract available segments during initial load.

- Implement Lazy-Loading Mechanism:

  - Detect missing segments in cached files based on follow-up query requests.
  - Load only the missing segments from disk on demand.
  - Merge newly loaded segments into cached file data and update metadata.

- Update Incremental Fetch Logic:

  - Modify incremental data fetch to check for missing segments in cached files.
  - Trigger targeted segment loading for partially cached files.
  - Update cache with merged segment data.

- Integrate with Query Intent Parser:

  - Ensure query intent includes requested segments.
  - Pass segment requests to caching layer for accurate incremental fetch decisions.

- Utilities and Services Involved:

  - dataRetrievalService.js: Extend to handle segment metadata and lazy-loading.
  - cache-utils.ts: Update to support merging segment data in cache.
  - queryProcessor.js (if applicable): Modify to include segment-level intent.
  - Controllers handling queries: Update to pass segment info.

- Routes Involved:
  - chat-assistant/route.ts
  - query/route.js

## Benefits:

- Efficient memory and data usage by loading only necessary segments.
- Improved responsiveness to follow-up queries with additional data needs.
- Scalable and maintainable cache management.
