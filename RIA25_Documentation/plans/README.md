# Implementation Plans Directory

This directory contains various implementation plans for the RIA25 project. The plans have been organized into two main subdirectories based on their implementation status:

## Directory Structure

- `complete/` - Contains plans that have been fully implemented in the codebase
- `current/` - Contains plans that are either partially implemented or not yet implemented

## Complete Plans (✅)

The following plans have been fully implemented:

1. **Data Retrieval Optimization** - Efficient file identification and data retrieval
2. **Direct File Access Mode** - Toggle-able direct file access with fallbacks
3. **Incremental Segment Retrieval** - Thread-specific caching for efficient follow-up queries
4. **OpenAI API Optimization** - Improved performance and response time
5. **Smart Filtering Implementation** - Demographic segment detection and data filtering
6. **Starter Question Optimization** - Fast-path processing for starter questions

## Current Plans (⚠️ or ❌)

The following plans are in progress or pending implementation:

1. **API Refactoring** (⚠️ Partially Implemented) - Standardizing API architecture
2. **Logging Migration** (⚠️ Partially Implemented) - Structured logging system
3. **Shared Utilities Library** (⚠️ Partially Implemented) - Centralized utility functions
4. **Smart Filtering and Segment-Aware Caching** (⚠️ Partially Implemented) - Enhanced caching
5. **Vercel KV Cache Migration** (❌ Not Implemented) - Production-ready persistent caching

## Implementation Priority

1. **Critical Priority**:

   - Vercel KV Cache Migration

2. **High Priority**:

   - Complete Smart Filtering and Segment-Aware Caching
   - Finish API Refactoring

3. **Medium Priority**:
   - Complete Shared Utilities Library
   - Finish Logging Migration
