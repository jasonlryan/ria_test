# Incremental Segment Retrieval Plan

## Objective

Implement and optimize incremental segment retrieval in the data retrieval system to reduce latency and token size of queries, while ensuring efficient cache usage and response payload management.

## Background

The current lazy loader implementation loads missing segments from disk and merges them into the cache. However, the response includes all requested segments' data, not just the incremental segments. This can lead to increasing payload sizes and latency as more segments are requested over time.

## Goals

- Enable the system to send only incremental segments in the response.
- Ensure the cache remembers previously loaded segments without requiring the entire dataset to be resent.
- Maintain or improve latency and token usage efficiency.
- Provide clear logging and monitoring of cache and segment loading.

## Approach

### Server-Side

1. **Cache Management**

   - Maintain a per-thread cache of loaded segments per file.
   - Update the cache with newly loaded segments on each query.

2. **Incremental Loading**

   - Identify missing segments per cached file.
   - Load only missing segments from disk.
   - Merge newly loaded segments into the cache.

3. **Response Optimization**

   - Modify response payloads to include only newly loaded (incremental) segments.
   - Include metadata indicating which segments are new vs. previously sent.

4. **Logging**
   - Add detailed logs for cache contents, loaded segments, missing segments, and incremental responses.

### Client-Side (if applicable)

1. **Cache Maintenance**

   - Maintain a local cache of received segments per file.
   - Merge incremental updates into the local cache.

2. **Request Management**
   - Request only new segments as needed.
   - Handle metadata indicating incremental updates.

## Testing

- Create test cases simulating incremental segment requests.
- Verify that only missing segments are loaded and sent.
- Confirm that client cache merges incremental updates correctly.
- Measure latency and token usage improvements.

## Feasibility and Considerations

- Requires coordinated changes on server and client.
- Ensures scalability by preventing unbounded payload growth.
- Improves user experience with faster responses and lower data usage.

## Next Steps

- Implement server-side incremental response logic.
- Update client-side to handle incremental updates (if applicable).
- Develop comprehensive tests.
- Monitor and optimize based on real usage.
