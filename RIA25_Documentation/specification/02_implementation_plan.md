# RIA25 Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implemented architecture, development workflow, and technical decisions for the RIA25 system, reflecting the actual build rather than initial planning.

## System Components

### 1. Data Processing Pipeline

- **Implemented Solution**: Node.js scripts to process CSV data into structured JSON
- **Key Scripts**:
  - `process_survey_data.js`: Transforms raw CSV data into structured JSON files
- **Output Format**: JSON files split by question number with consistent metadata structure
- **Location**: `scripts/` directory

### 2. Vector Store

- **Technology**: OpenAI-based vector database
- **Proposed Approach**: Use Assistants API with file uploads
- **Data Structure**: Individual question responses with associated metadata
- **Query Mechanism**: Semantic similarity search with context retrieval

### 3. Prompt Engineering

- **Approach**: Multi-layered system prompt with specific instructions for:
  - Segment detection and validation
  - Data accuracy confirmation
  - Anti-fabrication measures
  - Result formatting

* **Evolution**: Documented in `RIA25_Documentation/07_prompt_evolution.md`

### 4. Web Interface

- **Framework**: Next.js
- **Components**:
  - User input interface with query submission
  - Response display with formatting
  - Session management
  - API integration
- **Deployment**: Vercel

### 5. API Integration

- **Implementation**: OpenAI Assistants API
- **Authentication**: API key management via environment variables
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with appropriate user feedback

## Implementation Workflow

### Phase 1: Data Processing

1. Parse raw CSV data using `process_survey_data.js`
2. Transform into structured JSON format with consistent metadata
3. Split data by question number for efficient retrieval
4. Validate accuracy of processed data

### Phase 2: Vector Store Setup

1. Configure vector store parameters
2. Develop tools to ingest processed JSON files into the vector store
3. Test retrieval accuracy and adjust as needed
4. Implement error handling for vector operations

### Phase 3: Prompt Engineering

1. Develop initial prompt structure
2. Integrate segment detection rules
3. Implement anti-fabrication measures
4. Test and refine prompt for accuracy
5. Document prompt evolution

### Phase 4: Web Interface Development

1. Create Next.js application structure
2. Implement API integration components
3. Design user interface
4. Add error handling and loading states
5. Test user experience

### Phase 5: Deployment

1. Configure Vercel deployment
2. Set up environment variables
3. Implement monitoring
4. Complete documentation
5. Perform final testing

## Technical Decisions

### Data Structure

The implemented system uses individual JSON files for each question, with:

- Consistent metadata structure
- Demographic information
- Response data
- Year information

This approach was chosen over alternatives (single large JSON file, database) for:

- Simplified vector store ingestion
- Reduced memory requirements
- Improved retrieval accuracy

### Segment Handling

The implementation enforces a two-segment maximum rule:

- Prevents invalid cross-segmentation
- Maintains statistical validity
- Ensures response accuracy

### API Integration

OpenAI Assistants API was selected over alternatives due to:

- Built-in vector search capabilities
- Simplified file management
- Reduced development complexity
- Strong performance characteristics

## Challenges and Solutions

| Challenge                   | Solution                             |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| CSV format inconsistencies  | Robust column mapping implementation |
| Cross-segmentation validity | Two-segment rule enforcement         |
| Response fabrication        | Multi-layered verification prompts   |
| Vector retrieval accuracy   | Question-specific JSON files         |
| Response formatting         | Structured prompt instructions       |

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- **Logging**: Error logging for API interactions

## Next Steps

1. User feedback collection
2. Performance optimization
3. Enhanced analytics features
4. Preparations for future survey data
