OpenAI’s new Responses API—released on 11 March 2025—supersedes the Assistants API by merging Chat Completions’ simplicity with Assistants’ tool-use, adds first-class web-search, file-search and “computer-use” tools, introduces a leaner single-call workflow (client.responses.create), and is slated to replace the Assistants API entirely by mid-2026, so every project still on Assistants should start migrating now.

1 Why OpenAI is moving to the Responses API
OpenAI describes the Responses API as “our new API primitive for leveraging built-in tools to build agents,” designed to remove custom orchestration code and expose a unified, item-based response format.
Early adopter feedback confirmed that Assistants’ thread / run objects and tool-call plumbing were too heavyweight for most agentic use-cases; Responses collapses these into one HTTP call that can chain multiple model turns and tool calls automatically.

2 Deprecation timeline & support guarantees
March 2025 – Responses API GA.

Now–2026 H1 – feature-parity phase; Assistants remains functional but new features land first (or only) in Responses.

Mid-2026 – planned Assistants sunset; a formal migration guide and data-export path will be provided.

3 Conceptual changes developers must grok
Area Assistants API Responses API Impact
Endpoint /assistants/_ + /threads/_ + /runs/\* POST /responses Fewer round-trips
Conversation state Stored in threads by default Optional via previous_response_id or your own store flag (store=False) Gives you full control over memory
Roles system, user, assistant Adds developer role for inline overrides Finer-grained instruction hierarchy
Built-in tools File-search only (beta) Web-search, File-search, Computer-use; more coming Native agentic behaviours

Streaming SSE events with delta Same, but event names are response.output_text.delta, response.tool_call, etc.

4 New & improved capabilities
Web search ­– real-time information with automatic citation.

File search ­– natural-language queries across uploaded docs.

Computer use ­– model can navigate UIs programmatically (Azure also exposes this through CUA).

Function calling & structured output remain, but the schema is simplified to one list of tools per request.

5 Pricing, limits, models
The API itself is not billed separately—tokens and tool usage follow the standard GPT-4o / GPT-4o-mini rates.

Same global and org-level rate-limits apply; Responses inherits chat limits (RPM/TPM) for each model.

6 Step-by-step migration plan
Upgrade the SDK

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install --upgrade openai # requires >= 1.5.0
Swap the client call

python
Copy
Edit

# OLD

run = client.beta.threads.create_and_run(...)

# NEW

resp = client.responses.create(
model="gpt-4o",
input="Your prompt",
tools=[{"type": "web_search_preview"}],
stream=True # optional
)
print(resp.output_text)
Handle conversation state
For stateless interactions: set store=False.
For multi-turn: pass previous_response_id returned by the prior call.

Translate tool calls

File-search IDs carry over unchanged.

Replace run.steps[].tool_calls with the flattened tools array.

Adjust streaming handler – listen for response.output_text.delta instead of delta.content.
datacamp.com

Remove Assistant-specific objects – delete any thread_id, run_id, or assistant_id storage once you have confidence in the new flow.

7 Best-practice checklist
Use roles wisely: system for global policy, developer for app-level overrides, user for end-user input.

Keep prompts short—Responses auto-prunes earlier context when store=True.

Batch tool runs to minimise tokens (one call can chain tools).

Stream to the UI for perceived latency gains; sample code in DataCamp guide shows a robust loop.

Observe & trace using the new platform tracing dashboard; every response ID is trace-able.

8 Enterprise & Azure notes
Microsoft’s Azure AI Foundry exposes the same Responses API under Azure OpenAI, pairing it with the Computer-Using Agent (CUA) and multi-agent orchestration via Azure AI Agent Service.

Implementation takeaway
Allocate one sprint to prototype the new workflow (steps 1–4), a second to replace Assistants’ objects and update your persistence layer, and a final sprint for load-testing and observability integration. Doing so before autumn 2025 keeps you comfortably ahead of the mid-2026 Assistants sunset while unlocking richer agent capabilities today.
