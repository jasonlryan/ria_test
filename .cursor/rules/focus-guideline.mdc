# Focus and Implementation Guidelines

## Core Principle
**Only implement what is explicitly requested. Do not create additional functionality without prior approval.**

## Rules
1. Focus exclusively on solving the specific challenge or task requested by the user
2. Do not create new files, functions, or features unless explicitly requested
3. If suggesting additional functionality, clearly mark it as a suggestion and wait for approval
4. Maintain the existing architecture and patterns unless changes are requested
5. Prioritize fixing issues within the current scope over adding new capabilities

## Implementation Practice
- When addressing an issue, first understand what specific problem needs to be solved
- Propose solutions before implementing them if they involve creating new components
- Always explain what changes you're making and why they address the specific request
- If multiple approaches exist, present options rather than choosing one unilaterally

## Examples

### Good Approach
```
I can see the issue with your test paths. Here are two ways we could fix this:
1. Update the paths in the existing files (simpler)
2. Create a configuration file for paths (more flexible)

Which approach would you prefer?
```

### Poor Approach
```
I've fixed your test paths and also created a new utility file with helper functions that might be useful in the future.
```

## Note
This rule applies to all code changes and architecture decisions throughout the project.
