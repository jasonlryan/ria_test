# Utilities Directory

## Overview

This directory contains utility modules organized into logical domains to enhance maintainability and code organization.

## Directory Structure

- `/utils/cache/` - Caching and data persistence utilities
- `/utils/compatibility/` - Data compatibility checking and validation
- `/utils/data/` - Data processing, filtering, and type definitions
- `/utils/shared/` - Cross-cutting utilities used across multiple domains
  - `/utils/shared/iframe/` - Iframe resizing and communication utilities
  - `/utils/shared/logger.js` - Logging utilities
  - `/utils/shared/feature-flags.ts` - Feature toggle system
  - `/utils/shared/monitoring.ts` - Migration monitoring
  - `/utils/shared/rollback.ts` - Rollback management
  - `/utils/shared/helpers.tsx` - General helper utilities

## Migration Status

A high-stakes infrastructure refactoring is in progress to better organize utility code. Each subdirectory contains:

- A `README.md` explaining its purpose
- A `migration-log.txt` documenting migration steps
- Original files may have adapters for backward compatibility

## Usage Guidelines

- For new development, import utilities from their canonical locations
- Do not modify adapter files (files that re-export from new locations)
- Check subdirectory documentation for domain-specific guidelines

## Migration Timeline

The migration is being conducted incrementally to minimize risk:

- Cache system migration: Completed
- Compatibility system migration: Completed
- Data system migration: Completed
- Shared utilities migration: Completed
  - Core utilities moved: logger.js, iframe utilities
  - Feature management moved: feature-flags.ts, monitoring.ts, rollback.ts
  - General utilities moved: helpers.tsx

## Legacy Adapters

Adapter files in original locations will be maintained until all imports across the codebase have been updated. Do not remove adapters without thorough verification.
