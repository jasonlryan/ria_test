  "summary": "In 2025, countries are taking varied approaches to prepare for the rise of AI in the workplace. Survey data shows that organizations are investing in upskilling and reskilling programs, with a significant proportion of workers reporting increased access to learning and development opportunities (see files: 2025_5_1, 2025_17_3). Attitudes toward AI are generally positive, with many employees expressing excitement about AI's potential, though some concerns about job displacement remain (2025_5_2, 2025_5_3, 2025_5_8). Readiness to adopt AI varies by country and sector, with higher readiness reported in technology and professional services (2025_5_4 to 2025_5_7). Leadership confidence and organizational adaptation are key factors in successful AI integration, as reflected in files 2025_17_5, 2025_7_6, and 2025_17_7. Overall, the impact on workers includes both opportunities for skill growth and challenges related to change management and job security.",
