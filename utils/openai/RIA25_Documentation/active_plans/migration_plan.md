OpenAI Responses API Migration Plan
I've made initial changes to get started with the migration, but there are still some TypeScript issues to resolve. Here's what we need to do next:

1. Finish Service Layer Updates
   Update the UnifiedOpenAIService type definitions:
   Define proper type interfaces for the OpenAI Responses API
   Fix the type issues in the createResponse and continueConversation methods
   Update or remove other methods:
   Remove or update listMessages, retrieveRun, submitToolOutputs and related methods
2. Update Controller Layer
   Fix the type errors in chatAssistantController.ts:
   Implement proper type checking for the response objects
   Update the streaming implementation to work with Responses API output
   Simplify the code flow:
   Remove the complex thread/run handling
   Implement direct response handling with response IDs
3. Update the Caching Layer
   Expand ThreadCache interface:
   Add responseId to the interface definition
   Update related functions to handle this new property
4. Implement Tool Calling with Responses API
   Update tool calling implementation:
   Replace submitToolOutputs with the new pattern for Responses API
   Update file-search and web-search implementations
5. Update Tests
   Create new tests for Responses API:
   Test createResponse and continueConversation
   Test tool calling with the new API
   Execution Plan
   First focus on getting the basic flow working:
   Fix TypeScript issues in createResponse
   Update the cache utilities to store response IDs
   Update the controller to use the new pattern
   Then address tool calling and streaming:
   Update the tool calling implementation
   Fix the streaming implementation
   This approach will allow you to migrate incrementally while keeping the application functional.
