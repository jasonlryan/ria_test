# Cache System Reorganization

## Overview

This directory contains the reorganized cache system files for the RIA25 application. The cache system has been restructured to improve organization, maintainability, and encapsulation of cache-related functionality.

## File Structure

```
utils/cache/
├── cache-utils.ts         # Main cache interface
├── kvClient.ts            # KV client implementation
├── key-schema.ts          # Key schema definitions
└── README.md              # This documentation
```

## Migration Status

This reorganization follows the structured migration plan from `utils/cache_file_mapping.md`. The migration is being performed incrementally following these steps:

1. Create new directory structure
2. Move files one at a time in order of dependency
3. Create backward compatibility adapters
4. Update imports in application code (gradually)
5. Remove adapters once all imports are updated

## File Purpose

### cache-utils.ts

Provides a unified interface for all caching operations in the application. All cache interactions should go through this module.

### kvClient.ts

Implements the KV client with local fallback for development environments. Handles connection to Redis/Vercel KV.

### key-schema.ts

Defines the standardized key schema for all cached data to ensure consistent and predictable cache key patterns.

## Usage

Old code:

```typescript
import { UnifiedCache } from "../utils/cache/cache-utils";
```

New code:

```typescript
import { UnifiedCache } from "../utils/cache/cache-utils";
```

## Backward Compatibility

Adapter files have been created in the original locations to maintain backward compatibility during the migration process:

- `utils/cache-utils.ts` → `utils/cache/cache-utils.ts`
- `utils/shared/kvClient.ts` → `utils/cache/kvClient.ts`
- `utils/shared/key-schema.ts` → `utils/cache/key-schema.ts`

These adapter files will be removed once all imports have been updated to use the new paths.

## Error Fixes

As part of this migration, we've fixed several issues:

- Added defensive type checking to ensure `files` properties are always arrays before using array methods
- Improved error handling and logging
- Enhanced validation of cache data structures
